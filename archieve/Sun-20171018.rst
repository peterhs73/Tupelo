Graphene sample coating
=======================

Peter bought monolayer graphene and tried a few published methods for getting a free graphene layer on a liquid surface.  Preliminary findings: Holder, graphene on copper; the copper does not etch uniformly and the graphene breaks apart.  "It breaks into pieces during etching".  So was successful at picking up a monolayer of graphene floating on a liquid. 

Talked with Kyle Dorsey in the Paul McEuen group about graphene.  Consensus: "a lot of graphene papers are hype and not reproducible, so be careful about taking any paper's claims at face value."  

Switched to multilayer graphene. Found two papers with recipes to grow it. [#Jo2010apr]_ [#Kim2009jan]_  With Kyle Dorsey's help:

* Substrate: Ni[300 nm, e-beam deposition, 0.4 angstrom/s] / SiO2[290 nm] / Si[handle wafer]. 

The whole process takes about 3.5 hours; 1 hour warmup, 1.5 hours cooldown.  First, clean the surface: 

* Gases: 4 SCCM hydrogen, 100 SCCM argon

* Temperature: 300 degC

* Time: 30 min

Then deposit graphene:

* Gases: 5 SCCM hydrogen, 5 SCCM methane, 100 SCCM argon

* Time: 10 min

* Temperature: 900 degC

Grow graphene on a cleaved strip of the silicon substrate.  When done, break into smaller pieces.  Work with pieces approximately 2 cm by 1 cm in area.  Dip the sample piece into a (proprietary) copper etch [FeCl3, some HCl; used by CNF] for 20 minutes.  
 
The graphene layer floats off in a quite-large piece.  The graphene is visible to the naked eye but transparent.  Expect the graphene thickness, based on published work, to be 7 to 10 layers thick.  Estimate thickness as 0.35 nm/layer x 10 layers = 3.5 nm [`wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene>`__].  Estimate abs = 0.02/layer x 10 layers = 0.20, roughly consistent with the visible appearance. Can't see it on first try with profilometry.  Can't pick it up with tweezers but nevertheless "fairly robust".

Picked it up with glass slide, but the graphene broke into tiny pieces.  Set the CPW substrate on *top* of the floating graphene piece quickly -- could deposit a tiny piece on the CPW this way.  Corinne measured the resistance of the graphene sheet.

Next: Waiting for the etch solution, to reproduce the etch in out laboratory.  Transfer it from etching solution to pure water before depositing.

ELN
===

I use Pelican (in Python; markdown and rst).  Peter implements an ELN in Hugo (not Python, written in Go; works well with Markdown, not necessarily rst).  Peter has written Python scripts to copy the text file over and add a header with time/date.  Wrap the website in a GUI to make it easy to edit an entry.

A-Exam
======

Greg Ezra and Lena Kourkoutis-Fitting have agreed to serve on Peter's A-Exam committee.

Travel
======

Depart 1 January.  Away two months.  Approximate return 1 March.  *Approximate* because he has to renew both Passport (every ten years) and Visa.  Expect that Marohn needs to write a letter.  Peter will contact Cornell's ISO about what the letter should look like.

I authorize Peter to start shopping for flights.

While away, Peter will study my Magnetic Resonance class notes.

Moving forward
==============

To start, Peter would like to work on MRFM simulation code and continue Hoang's image-reconstruction work.  

Me: Look at the SPINACH package created by Ilya Kuprov's gruop [#Spinach]_ [#Hogben2011feb]_.  With Köckenberger, Kuprov and coworkers have simulated DNP [#Karabanov2012feb]_.  An interesting question for us it how DNP works in a few gauss/ansgstrom magnetic field gradient.

Folder Location File extension as content and external document for syncing Option to clean up Markdown format requirements As of version16 Coyote no longer requires special format for image and files Please name the files with the title in mind Use instead of space for filenames Math only use for math codes will not work is going to render to a italic to avoid in math put a space after the first and than add in between codes workaround for version 10 apparently 32 automatically renders to tag which also causes trouble currently Use 32 for version 10 fixed in version 12 this is due to the

resonance Recent advances and future challengeshttpsarxivorgabs10063736 pdf General Combines the physics of MRI with scanning probe microscopy NMR Force between the electron or nuclear spins in the sample and a nearby magnetic particle Conventional MRI The sample is placed in a strong static manetic field in order to produce a Zeeman splitting between the nuclear spin states The sample is then exposed to a radio frequency rf magnetic field of a precisely defined frequency It this frequency matches the Zeeman splitting which at a given static field is different for every nonzero nuclear spin isotope then the system absorbs energy from the rf radiation resulting in transiitons between the nuclear spins The procession of this ensemble of nuclear magnetic moments produces a timvarying magnetic singal that can be detected with a pickup coil The magntic field produced by nuclear moments are extremely small more than 1012 nuclear spins are needed detect the electric current induced MRFM Imaging taking two refrigerator magnets and holding them close together They exert etiher an attractive or repulsive force A compliant cantilever is used to sense the same magnetic forces arising between the nuclear spins in a sample and a nearby nanomagnet Either the sample containing nuclear moments or the nanomagnet must be fixed to the cantilever The nuclear spins are made to periodically flip generating an oscillating magnetic force acting on the cantilever To resonatly excite the cantilever the nuclear spins must be inverted at the cantilevers mechanical resonance frequency The cantilevers mechanical oscillations are then measured by an optical interferometer or beam dectector The electronic signal produced by the optical detector is proportional both to the cantilver oscillation amplitude and the number of nuclear spins in the imaging volume Spatial resolution results from th fact that the nano magnet produces a magnetic field which is a strong function of position The magnetic resonance condiction and therefreo the region where the spins periodically flip is confined to a think approximately hemispherical resonant slice that extend toward from the nanomagnet Force dectection vs inductive Best resolution achieved by inductively detected MRI require sample volumes at least 3 m3 Mechanical devices usually show resonant quality factors thta surpass those of inductive circuits by orders of mangnitde High cantilever factor and low temperature Tiponcantilever the protocols include the detection of spin singals in the form of a shift in the cantilever resonance frquency rather than change in amplitude Dectecting a force gradient Issues broadiening of resonance lines by the strong field gradient of the magnetic tip completely dominates any intrinsic spectral features Questions How is force dectected How to control to map different slices Whats the frequency at whats the force sensitivity mean per squred Hz just the cantilever

batchandserial fabrication protocol The method differs from the conventional batch protocol that deposit metals directly onto cantilevers Instead the metals Nickel and Cobalt are patterned onto a

which the total agular momentum Ltot has one of the values Ltot JJ112 hbar where J takes integer values J 012 and hbar is reduced Plancks constant quantization of total angular momentum The rotational energy of a molecule is proportional to the square of the total angular momentum so the energy is also quantized For a rigid molecule the energies of the stable rotational states are EJ BJJ1 Where B is the rotational constant for the molecule small for heavy atom and large for a light one The total angular momentum of the molecule determines how fast it is rotating but conveys no information on the axis of the rotation More details about oth rotation of teh molecule is given by specifying a second quantum number MJ Takes one of the 2J1 ineteger values MJ J J1J has information about the

describes the distribution of power into frequency components composing that signal Applies to signals existing over all time or over a time period large enough in relationship to the duration of a measurement that can be treated as over an infinite time interval PSD power spectral density refers to the spectral energy distribution that would be found per unit time Digital Signal Processing Book

differs from zero Magnitude how far regardless of direction its quantity differs from zero always positive The power of a signal is proportional to its amplitude squared Timeinvariant shiftinvariant system is one where a time delay or shift in the input sequence causes a equivalent time delay in the systems output sequence Unit impulse response the systems time domain output sequence when the input is a single unityvalued sample unit impulse preceded and followed by zerovalued samples Given linear time invariant systems timedomain impulse response find the systems frequency response by

fs sampless if k is any positive or negative integer we cannot distinguish between the sampled values of a sinewave of f0 Hz and a sinewave of f0 k fs Hz Frequency fs2 is an important quantity in sampling theory and is referred to as critical Nyquist half Nyquist and folding frequency A general illustration of aliasing is provided in the sharks tooth pattern Sampling Lowpass signals Band

Interferometer Principle Laser diode passes light into a flexible optical fiber Light passes through a fiberoptic coupler Light travels to the cleaved end of the optical fiber 4 of the initial power is reflected from the surface of the cleaved edge and remains in the optical fiber 96 of the power exits the fiber and is reflected off the object of interest Light reenters the fiber and interferes with the fraction of light initially reflected at the cleaved end of the optical fiber eventually reaching the photodiode where it is transduced into a voltage The change in path length Delta l for a given change in distance x is Delta l 2 x If the object is moved by a distance of lambdal2 where lambdal is the wavelength of the laser the total change in the path length will be Delta l lambdal and we will have passed though one period of the interference pattern The most sensitive change in output signal is midway between a peak and valley on the roughly sinusoidal interference pattern As the distance between the fiber and the object increases the total power decreases The interference pattern is not a pure sinusoid but an envelope to the signal If approximate it as a sinusoid Vx V0 A sin

underdamped an oscillator or resonator is characterizes a resonators bandwidth relative to its center frequency Sinusoidally driven resonators having higher Q factors resonate with greater amplitudes at resonant frequency but have a smaller range of frequencies around that frequency for which they resonate the range of frequencies for which the resonates is called the bandwidth A highQ tuned circuit in a radio receiver would be more difficult to tune but more selectivity Two definitions frequency to bandwidth ratio of the resonator the ratio of the energy stored in the oscillating resonator to the energy dissipated per cycle by damping process System with low quality factor Q 12 underdamped Oscillation at specific frequency with a decay of the amplitude of the signal Paper Quality Factors in Micron and SubmicronThick Cantilevershttpieeexploreieeeorgdocument825786 Yasumura2000March Notes Energy dissipation in the cantilever causes the stored mechanical energy to leak away and be converted into heat The stronger the coupling between the cantilever and heat bath the faster the decay of cantilever and heat bath the faster the decay of cantilever motion toward thermal equilibrium and the lower the mechanical quality factor Q of the oscillating mode Conversely the coupling to heat bath has the consequence that the cantilever will be subjected to constant random excitation by its interaction with the many microscopic degrees of freedom in the heat bath Fluctuationdissipation theorem End result the lower the mechanical Q of the system the larger the force noise For a cantilever operating in vacuum vibrational energy can be dissipated via coupling to the support structure clamping loss and by internal friction Internal friction results from a variety of physical mechanisms including motion of lattice defects thermoelastic dissipation TED phononphonon scattering etc Surface effects can dominate for submicronthick cantilevers or for resonators with very high Q Clamping loss was studied theoretically by Jimbo and Itao For submicronthick cantilevers operating at kilohertz frequencies TED is negligible Internal friction and the relative importance of volume and surface contributions we now consider a simple model of a vibrating cantileever where we treat the stress and strain in the cantilever as scalars ignoring tensor properties and assume that the cantilever vibration amplitude is small compared to the length of the cantilever For a cantilever with rectangular cantilever the volume integral is over the cantilever thickness z t2 to z t2 width y w2 to y w2 and length x 0 to x 1 The exact form of Sigmamgamma depends on the cantilever geometry and vibrational mode shape Q factor is independent of cantilever geometry and vibrational mode shape Pan Walker Key Terms Static Friction Friction between two or more solid objects that are not moving relative to each other The coefficient of static friction typically denoted as mus is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction The maximum possible friction force between two surfaces before sliding begins is the product of the coefficient of static friction and the normal force

pdfhttpswwwcscmueduafscsacademicclass15462f11wwwlecslideslec19pdf My poor understanding of rendering difference The most intensive calculate are raypath tracing light color texture In blender the two most important settings are tiles and samples Here is a very good answer The difference and why there are different optimal bucket sizes comes from the size and design of on chip cachememory of cpu or gpu The gpu has a massive amount of cores But they are dumb and cannot do much logic They have a big data throughput though so thats why is good to give them a big chunk of data There will be a lot of parallelization done on that data and each core will do its dumb thing over and over again till its done The parallelization happens internally in gpu so in reality you would have to assign like 2x2 or 4x4 tile to each of those little cores but you would have 3000 of those tiles But since they share cachevram you assign a big tile to them Therefore the more CUDA cores the bigger tile Its worth noting that Kepler Maxwell or Pascall cuda cores are not equal so its best to test the ideal tile size between generations When mixing different gpus if you must its generally best to go with the tile size of the least powerfull one Many commercial renderers divide the last tile into smaller ones so the coresgpus that are finished can still render This does not happen yet with Cycles so it might happen that the last tile can end up as a job for the slowest gpu and if the tile is too big the rest of gpus will wait too long for the next frame doing nothing The cpu has low amount of cores but comparably to gpus cores they are superpowerful Each such core can operate on a bigger chunk of data and since individual cores do not share cache you have that many tiles as you have cores actually threads Each core has approx 416MB of cache and that reflects the optimal tile size CPU follows instruction cycle in a sequential manner Most CPU are in 3 4 GHz range and 4 core as 2017 It process calculation very fast and has monstrous cache to buffer A big monster with a big plate GPU is equivalent of large amount of parallel computing each core combined into instruction streams has low computing power and low memory bucket Thousands small monsters with small plates If the tile size is too small some cores of GPU are essentially waiting for calculation thus needs to increase tile size Oppositely CPU optimizes when tile size is small A recommended tile size for CPU is 64 x 64 and 256 x 256 for GPU A more depth optimization could be optimizing tile size to resolution because if resolution is 1920 x 1080 a tile size of 256 x 256 will have a left over tile that are smaller which again not efficient for GPU several small tile size that wastes computing GPU rendering script

script is detailed in the MRFMAnimBlenderScriptxlsx file V41 The most recent version I forgot what I changed V40 Stop camera movement at the precession stage only moves around when RF is present Stop camera movement during the whole cantilever frequency change process V39 Fixed the rendering of the magnetic field mag0 at frame 9451080 Fixed the camera dip at the very begining Increase the box frame height to avoid background leak for begining of several frames Fixed the spin angle at the end of the switch V38 Fixed the glitch at frame 1045 z angle Shifted everything betwen 1080 1130 by 8 frames should be okay if something go wrong please go back to version37 added still frames no camera movement between 2175 frames and 2189 frames to add cantilever movement if desired V35 Changed B0 and B1 emission to a brighter color R 10 G 02 B 0 and brighter emission 13 for B0 and 15 for B1 Changed waveguide color R 10 G 09 B 0 and roughness to 03 Changed resonance line emission to 20 Fixed the RF problem during zoom in render stops at 1130 Killed camera rotation during zooming in Camera still during procession Camera moves downwards during spin flip Changed camera zoom in motion at the beginning needs to render in 50 frames per second Smoothed out camera zoom out effect after relaxation Stopped the camera motion between frames 1885 1899 before the RF kicks in repeat the frames in between Changed the height of the starting step 2 B0 field and changed it to an arrow It will end up merge to a column Changed the initial height of B0 field and responding transitions of other fields The key frame locations were not changed Changed B1 to Btip Animation Plots Changelog V2 Added turnable RF turns and simplified the calculation function Added additional white dotted line over the plot to give the mid dotted line Combined RF frequency to a single plot Changed fonts and line width to fit the animation Changed figure size and the figure resolution dpi Video Edit Changelog Script detailed under MRFMVideoEditScriptxlsx file V40 Need to change the file referring all broken when changed file name to v40"},{"title":"Jocular Lab
